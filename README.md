# Blek-Market
Blek-Market is a supermarket billing system. This supermarket billing system is created to assist cashier workers to calculate the total price of items that are purchased by the customers. To make the cashier worker's job more convenient, the system allows them to type in the product ID and get the price of the item, thus calculating the total bill.
Besides that, the system allows the administrators to add, edit, search, delete and view all the products. If a record is no longer needed, administrators can remove and edit the record by using the system.
